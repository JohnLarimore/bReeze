An R package collecting functions for wind resource assessment

======

bReeze is a collection of widely used methods to analyse, visualise and interpret wind data. Wind resource analyses can subsequently be combined with characteristics of wind turbines to estimate the potential energy production.

bReeze is developed by Christian Graul, considerably based on the work of Carsten Poppinga.
